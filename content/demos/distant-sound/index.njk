      <p class="poem">Late August, given heavy rain and sun<br />
        For a full week, the blackberries would ripen. <br />
        At first, just one, a glossy purple clot<br />
        Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.<br />
        You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet<br />
        Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it<br />
        Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for<br />
        Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br />
        Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br />
        Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br />
        Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br />
        We trekked and picked until the cans were full,<br />
        Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br />
        With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br />
        Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br />
        With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.<br />
        <br />
        We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br />
        But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br />
        A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br />
        The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br />
        The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br />
        I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br />
        That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br />
        Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.<br /></p>
